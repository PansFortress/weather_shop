# Weather Shop 
This app will allow a user to input a number of geo related fields and search for the weather in the area of that time. Depending on the weather, we will recommend a number of potential items to purchase to help survive those weather conditions.

### Things to Investigate
1. Grabbing lat/long data from Google Maps API
2. Sending lat/long data to Dark Sky API to get back details regarding the weather
3. Using the details we receive back to identify weather type and make a call to Etsy API to grab defined items
4. Display those items for the user to buy on the results page in text format
